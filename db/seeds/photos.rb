    comment: "This summer, Haley and I have gotten really close! We both work at the Liberty Lake, WA office, and we
              usually try to have lunch together or take break together a couple times a week. It has been great making friends with
              another intern because we are always talking about projects we are working on and what kind of jobs we are
              interested in. I know Haley and I will stay friends after our internships are over, especially since our
              universities are only 30 minutes away from each other. Her internship is over about 3 weeks sooner than
              mine is, I will miss seeing her in the office!"

              However, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit her office and shadow UWs and see what a day in her
              office was like. The day after we both drove to Camp Hill, PA where we shadowed a claims specialist. Finally on
              the last day we went to the Raven's stadium in Baltimore after volunteering as role players for a Surveillance
              course conducted by the Department of Homeland Security. We had a meeting in the locker room where we met the
              students and then we had the chance to walk on the field!"

              to New York to talk to our friend about new car replacement at Liberty Mutual. He advised us that if we drop 40K
              on a new set of wheels and we get tee-boned by a minivan, Liberty Mutual will cover the full value of my car, no
              depreciation. Liberty Mutual offers New Car Replacement as a standard feature on their auto policies. It was a
              great trip and we were able to sight-see the statue of Liberty!"

              questions about the systems and processes used in our department. Lucikly, we were surrounded by co-workers who were
              always willing to take time out of their days to help us whenever we needed it.

              Here's a picture of Chelsey and I with some of the new hires in our office. We have been lucky enough to be able to
              pass onto them the amazing support we received when we first started.

              Now, not only are they our coworkers, but also our friends!"

                'IMEC Corporate Volunteer Day'. While volunteering, we were introducted to IMEC's missions and the
                culture of the organization. Project wise, we assisted with the building of suites (or the compilation of donated
                medical supplies) which will be sent to impoverished hospitals in just a few weeks. This picture was taken outside of
                the facility after our day of service ended. We left the IMEC location feeling accomplished, knowing that we had helped
                those in need! (Pictured from left to right: Myself, Lexie Foerschner, Aliki Kalpaxis)"

                beautiful if you stroll through the Boston Commons and jump right on the red line at Park station. From the numerous
                lawn games to the giant swings seen above, this place perfectly meets the expectation of being an
                'adult playground.' We even took some time to just sit in a sunny area in the middle of the lawn and enjoy
                each others company. We highly reccomend this to all of our fellow interns!"

      comment: "I am interning in the No Fault department of Personal Insurance at the Liberty Lake, Washington office.
                This summer, my main project is getting Aux codes on the PL Fast Path phones, getting the adjusters trained
                on how to use Aux codes, and following the progress of this project with the CMS Manager Toolbar. My main
                goal is lowering the precentage of abandoned calls so we can provide a higher level of service to our
                customers, and overall improve the customer experience. My manager, Jamie Bowman and I decided to take a
                silly picture to show what a great working relationship we have! Jamie is a great manager, he gives me
                guidance when I ask for it, and otherwise allows me to have freedom in my project. I am building my skillset
                this summer by being the project manager of this phones project, and I hope to put all my skills to good
                use after I graduate next June by being hired for a full time position at Liberty Mutual."

                each other very well over the last month and a half. I have learned so much about mainframes from John and
                others on my team and I continue to learn more each day. John and I share an interest in powerful cars and
                powerful computers. This picture is of us in front of one of Liberty Mutual's mainframe supercomputers, an
                IBM z196, in the Portsmouth data center. This computer, along with another, are responsible for processing

                is under construction right now, so we had to wear hardhats and safety glasses to get there."

      comment: "In Underwriting negotiation is key, especially with our agents. I was able to effectively negotiate with my underwriting manager and my mentor to take a picture with few props to keep the office atmosphere light.

                Pete is our superhero; he is very helpful and assigns meaningful projects while keeping the office in order to hit our
                goals. My mentor Danielle is incredible; she answers any questions I have about quoting new business and
                reaches out to other departments for me to shadow, such as middle markets and risk control, so I have a
                well-rounded internship experience."

                Standing in front of our Service Principles--

                We do what's right... we surprise our manager with iced coffee!

                We're there when we're needed... Fridays ALWAYS call for caffeine!

                We provide solutions... the right coffee cures anything!

                We make things easy... Andrew appreciated our hand-delivery of his favorite afternoon beverage!

                My fellow intern, Erin, and I work in the CI Claims Department handling subrogation in Weston, MA. Since
                the start of our internship, Andrew has supported us constantly, provided us with all the appropriate resources,
                and has been our number one fan. We will never be able to thank him enough for all he has done for us, but I guess
                we'll start with an iced coffee.



                Happy Friday, everyone!!!"

      comment: "I am working in the Boston, MA office and this weekend, I went kayaking on the Charles River with two
                other Liberty Mutual interns. It was so much fun and definitely a great way to stay active. The weather was
                perfect and the views were incredible. We even saw the Liberty Mutual tower during our trip! For everyone
                else in the Boston office, this is an experience you don't want to miss."

                Photo below is from today's lunch. It was a great opportunity to get to know each other. Can you guess who
                on the photo does not like honey? Who would like to have door in lilac/violet color? And who is going to
                send us a selfie from Great Wall of China? :)    "

      comment: "I am working in the Dover, NH office and was invited to march in the 2015 Boston Pride Parade
                (which LM helped sponsor!).  The day was a blast, and it was great to see our company supporting its employees
                and the LGBTQ community as a whole!  Getting to lead our group and hold the banner the entire way was pretty
                neat too :p"

      comment: "No matter where I go or what I do, I am always representing Northeastern University. While travelling abroad this past semester, I frequently wore my bright red Northeastern University Husky Ambassador (tour guide) jacket and I was stopped throughout Europe by Americans addressing my jacket and asking me about Northeastern. One day while helping a few lost American high school students find their destination, I met a girl who applied early decision to Northeastern and another prospective student and I was able to answer all of their admissions and general NU questions while on the streets of Florence, Italy!! My love for Northeastern travels with me wherever I go and I am proud to be a tour guide and a representative of my school. In this picture I am wearing my tour guide jacket in St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City!!"

Definitely a highlight of my college career, something I will never forget. We were the underdogs, but we came in fierce and we all beat our best times. And I'm pretty sure I lost my voice cheering my teammates on the whole weekend!"

      comment: "This picture is from my last race of the 2015 rowing season at the Dad Vail Regatta in Philadelphia, PA. For the first time in Bryant Rowing's 5 year club sport program, our boat finished with a faster time than a Division 1 team. I am the coxswain (in the front of the boat) and could not have this success without the dedication of the four ladies rowing. We train hard all year round on and off the water and are proud to be Bryant Bulldogs!"

It was also our Welles Crowther Red Bandanna game, in honor of a BC alum who we lost on 9/11. Definitely an all-around emotional game, and one that made us proud to be Eagles! (I am front left.)"
