#### The basic idea is for a recruitment tool for current and potential interns.

To check out the intern sections you can [log in](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in) with the email: *paul@darragh.com* and the password: *topsecret*

For current interns we noticed a need to help with connecting interns with other interns that they might have met. Typically when interns met they know balis information like their first name, last name, college or major.

We also noticed a number of attempts of interns trying to connect and socialize out of work and decided to help facilitate those meetings with a place to post events. So if interns where going to an event such as a chowder festival or just wanted to play weekly soccer they could create or find an event. If they foudn one they could RSVP to the event to let others know that they are planning on going ot it and after the event is over they can go back, view or upload pictures to that event so others can see them.

Liberty Mutual also runs a weekly photo challenge that interns are encouraged to participate in. This is hosted on the intern hub, but after doing some user testing with random interns we found a number of interns who did not know or could not find where to post a photo for the photo challenge. We decided to help with this by creating a simple place for interns to go, view the photos of past and current photo challenges and to upload their own if they haven't already done that.
