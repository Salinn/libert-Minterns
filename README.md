For current interns we noticed a need to help with connecting interns with other interns that they might have met. Typically when interns met they know balis information like their first name, last name, college or major. To view this funtionality you can go to [this page](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/users).

We also noticed a number of attempts of interns trying to connect and socialize out of work and decided to help facilitate those meetings with a place to post events. So if interns where going to an event such as a chowder festival or just wanted to play weekly soccer they could create or find an event. If they foudn one they could RSVP to the event to let others know that they are planning on going ot it and after the event is over they can go back, view or upload pictures to that event so others can see them. To view this funtionality you can go to [this page](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/events).

Liberty Mutual also runs a weekly photo challenge that interns are encouraged to participate in. This is hosted on the intern hub, but after doing some user testing with random interns we found a number of interns who did not know or could not find where to post a photo for the photo challenge. We decided to help with this by creating a simple place for interns to go, view the photos of past and current photo challenges and to upload their own if they haven't already done that. To view this funtionality you can go to [this page](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/photo_challenges).

Liberty mutual has a focus on work/life balance and we wanted to help show this off through showing off the photos from the photo challenges or events. This can show all of the fun interns have been having for the last few months. To view this funtionality you can go to [this page](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/public_images).

With over 600 interns with varying majors and jobs each year we thought that if they wrote summaries of their internship expierence we could show off to potential interns all of the different types of jobs and work that is out there that they could get involved in. We made this searchable also though tags. To view this funtionality you can go to [this page](http://liberty-minterns.herokuapp.com/summaries).

We also wanted to help interns find commonly asked questions and give them the the chance to ask their own questions. The idea behind this is to help provide an outlet for students to submit questions for HR to answer and to see information that othert students have found helpful. We have done this through giving each question a rating and sorting it by that rating.
